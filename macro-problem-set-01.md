Problem Set 1
========================================================

## Instructions

0. Deadline: Thursday, 23-August-2012

1. You don't have to type your answers, handwriting it's perfectly acceptable and even preferable in a first pass. Later, I'll ask you and your classmates to produce a properly written solution, in $\mathrm{\LaTeX}$.

2. It's OK (it's encouraged, even) to work in pairs or groups. But you need to submit individual set of answers and it shouldn't be identical.

3. Your grade is the grade of the answer sheet you submitted ... subject to an important contingency: after the deadline is met, I'll take a short quiz for everyone, with one of the questions featured in the problem set and I'll grade it. *If you score a red grade* then it will become your final grade for the entire problem set. So say that you submitted your Problem Set 2, and you got a 5.8 grade. But if later I ask you **one** question of the same PS 2, and you do it poorly and get a 3.1 grade, then 3.1 becomes your final grade for PS 2 is . But if you score a 6.5 in the quiz, then your 5.8 stays as the definitive grade.


## Exercise 1: Solow-Swan's differential equation

Let's solve, for the Cobb-Douglas case, the differential equation that describes the dynamics of (per capita) capital accumulation. If the production function is given by $Y_t = A K_t^\alpha L_t^{1-\alpha}$, and in per capita terms by $y_t = A k_t^{\alpha}$, then the DE is :

$$
\begin{equation}\label{kdiffeq}
\dot{k}_t = s k_t^{\alpha} - (n + \delta) k_t
\end{equation}
$$


1. Put the DE in standard form: $\frac{d y}{d x} + P(x) y = Q(x)$.


2. Solve the equation in standard form, using the Integrating Factor technique that you saw in class.


3. Transform your solution to give a solution for $k_t$.

## Exercise 2: Cobb-Douglas production functions with either labor augmenting , capital augmenting or neutral productivity.

1. Simple: write all three versions of the C-D function. Use $A$ for neutral productivity, $B$ for labor augmenting productivity and $C$ for the capital augmenting one. 

2. Show that both $B$ and $C$ can be written as one-to-one functions of $A$. 

## Exercise 3: FOCs in a CES with many inputs

1. **Discrete case**. Let $P$ be the price of output and $P_i$ the prices of each input. Show that, if the production function is given by,

\[
Y = N \left( \frac{1}{N} \Sigma_{i=1}^{N} X_i^\eta \right)^{1/\eta} 
\]

the profit maximization implies
\[
\frac{N X_i}{Y} = \left( \frac{P_i}{P}  \right)^{-1/(1-\eta)} 
\]

1. **Continuum case**. Let $P$ be the price of output and $P_i$ the prices of each input. Show that, if the production function is given by,

\[
Y = N \left( \int_0^1 X_i^\eta \right)^{1/\eta} 
\]

the profit maximization implies
\[
\frac{X_i}{Y} = \left( \frac{P_i}{P}  \right)^{-1/(1-\eta)} 
\]

## Exercise 4: conditioning and marginalizing 

+ 4.1 Write down Bayes rule for $f_{X|Y}(x|y)$ 
+ 4.2 Write down Bayes rule for $f_{X|Y,Z}(x|y,z)$, maintaining the conditioning on $Z=z$.
+ 4.3 Show how  can you obtain $f(x,y)$ using only $f(x,y,z$) or using together $f_{Y,X|Z}(x,y|z)$ and $f_{Z}(z)$. 
+ 4.4 Suppose that $x$ and $y$ have a joint distribution that is uniform. The support of the joint distribution is given by $\{(x,y): x \in (0,y), y \in (0,1)\}$.
   - Draw a diagram showing the support of $f(x,y)$.
   - You already know the joint is uniform (thus, a constant). Find out what is proper constant height of the joint.
   - Find the marginal density  $f_X(x)$.
   - Find the conditional density $f_{Y|X}(y|x)$ 



## Exercise 5: Chain rule
+ Let $z_t := Ln Z_t$ be a function of $Z_t$, and let $Z_t$ be a function of time, $t$. Use the chain rule to obtain an expression for $\dfrac{\partial z_t}{\partial t}$ in terms of $Z_t$ and $\dot{Z}_t$.
+ Let $y=f(z)$, $z=h(x)$. Use the chain rule to obtain an expression for  $\dfrac{\partial y}{\partial x}$
+ Let $y=f(z)$, $z=(z_1,z_2,z_3)$, $z_i=h(x)$, $x=(x_1,x_2)$. Use the chain rule to obtain an expression for  $\dfrac{\partial y}{\partial x_2}$.

# Exercise 6: Difference and differential stability

- Consider the matrix $A$, below:
$$
A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}
$$
   + Write down the characteristic polynomial of matrix $A$: 

   + Find the eigenvalues of $A$ using the characteristic equation
   
- Consider the system of equations on $(\dot{\aleph}_t, \dot{\pi}^e_t)$ that appear in Chapter 2, section 2.5.
    + Write it in matrix form
    + Write the characteristic polynomial
    + Write the solutions to the characteristic equations
    
- What is the condition for the local stability of the steady state in a system of differential equations?

# Exercise 7: Summation and lag operators.
+ If $|\beta|<1$ what is the value of $\sum_{i=0}^\infty \beta^i$
+ Let $\mathcal{L}$ be the lag operator. If $|\lambda|<1$ what is the value of $\sum_{i=0}^\infty (\lambda \mathcal{L})^i = \sum_{i=0}^\infty \lambda^i \mathcal{L}^i$ ?
+ If $|\mu|<1$ what is the value of $\sum_{i=0}^\infty (\mu \mathcal{L}^{-1})^i = \sum_{i=0}^\infty \mu^i \mathcal{L}^{-i}$ ?
+ Why $\dfrac{D z_t}{1 -\mu \mathcal{L}^{-1}} = \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} D \mu^{j} E_t[z_{t+j}]$ ?
